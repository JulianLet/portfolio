<!-- summery -->
This project was part of our Game Design 2 course where we were asked to create a **Shoot 'em up game**. At the start of the course each random assigned group got a initial theme for their project. Our was _Toxic Workplace_, which led to us choosing a coorperate building as a setting. The protagonist is the evil wizard boss who has to fight against the unionized workers.

<!-- my focus -->
In this project we were two programming students colaborating. My focus was on the **inventory and crafting system**. Defeated enemys dropped items which the player could use to craft new spells to unlock stronger attacks.

For the final version of the game I was also in charge of creating the **level design**. That included level layouts, as well as setting up the enemy spawners. One aspect I remember to be challenging was, as we chose a diagonal perspective, the layering between the sprites.

<!-- reflection -->
This was my first bigger _Unity_ project and, looking back I am very happy on how it turned out. Considering we were in the second semester of our game design programm and I have only been programming for four month. With the knowledge I have now there has to be said that we choose a very ambishos goal. Having four different enemies, ten levels and ten different spells led to us neglegting some aspects like decorating the levels. But I am so pleased that we managed to finish this project and got lots of positive feedback for it.
